Introduction:

This is a very simple demo GUI intended to function as a basic twitter clone. It is intended to be run along side the API
created by the Spring program 'ChasTwitterTest'.

By the way - please don't judge this project too harshly. This was the first GUI I ever created using REACT, and it was all written 
in literally just 2 days. So.... yeah, the quality is not the best as a result.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparation:

This program can only be run on a system with the program 'ChasTwitterTest' running on it.

The app can only be run on a system with node.js installed on it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting the program:

To start the program, run
 - npm start
See the full React documentation here: https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html

Known issues:

The system is currently a hacker's dream as it provides virtually no security of any kind. I did not implement these
in order to save time and because the test's specification did not ask for additional security features.

The worst offenders are the following:
  - Passwords are currently stored in plaintext as opposed to being encrypted. Unacceptable in a production environment
  - All Apis are wide open and don't check the credentials of the client. Again, unacceptable for any real system.
