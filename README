Introduction:

This is a very simple demo GUI intended to function as a basic twitter clone. It is intended to be run along side the API
created by the Spring program 'ChasTwitterTest'.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preparation:

This program can only be run on a system with the program 'ChasTwitterTest' running on it.

The app can only be run on a system with node.js installed on it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Starting the program:

To start the program, run
 - npm start

Known issues:

The system is currently a hacker's dream as it provides virtually no security of any kind. I did not implement these
in order to save time and because the test's specification did not ask for additional security features.

The worst offenders are the following:
  - Passwords are currently stored in plaintext as opposed to being encrypted. Unacceptable in a production environment
  - All Apis are wide open and don't check the credentials of the client. Again, unacceptable for any real system.

When the GUI is opened in a browser, it's CORS policy may prevent it from accessing the API. To circumvent this problem,
a possible solution is to install a plugin to the browser that temporarily disables the CORS policy.
Another solution is creating a shortcut to Google Chrome with CORS disabled:
  - Right click on desktop, add new shortcut
  - Add the target as "[PATH_TO_CHROME]\chrome.exe" --disable-web-security --disable-gpu --user-data-dir=~/chromeTemp
  - Click OK.
